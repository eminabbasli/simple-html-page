    <p>The 2024 BMW X5 M is one of the best-looking supercrossovers in the executive segment. It is also better than its predecessors in every aspect and needs only a slight power boost to take a swing at the exotic establishment dominated by the Ferrari Purosangue and Lamborghini Urus.
        Without any modifications, it can sprint to 60 mph (97 kph) in just 3.7 seconds, tapping out at 155 mph (250 kph). The top speed increases to 177 mph (285 kph) with the optional M Driver's Package.
        
        Under the hood, the 2024 BMW X5 M Competition features a mild-hybrid twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8, an eight-speed transmission with quicker changes and shorter gearing, an xDrive AWD system, Active M Differential, and dedicated brakes and suspension.
        
        The ICE has updated turbos, a new intake duct, a cross-bank exhaust manifold, a reinforced crankshaft, and a few other updates, unleashing 617 hp (625 ps/460 kW) and 553 lb-ft (750 Nm) of torque. That's only 40 hp (41 ps/30 kW) and 100 Nm (74 lb-ft) shy of the mighty Lamborghini Urus Performante, which is half a second quicker to sixty and maxes out at 306 kph (mph).</p>
